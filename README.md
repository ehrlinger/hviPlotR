## The hviPlotR package ##
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/5745/ehrlinger/hviPlotR.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11780)

A set of tools for creating publication quality graphics in *R* conforming to the standards of the clinical investigations statistics group within The Heart \& Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.

The *hviPlotR* package is an implementation of the plot.sas macro we currently use in *SAS*.  The package includes a set of themes designed to format those figures for both manuscript and presentation publication targets as well as helper functions to simplify the specific needs of the HVI statistics group.


We include a package vignette which has detailed recipes for generating our standard graphics using *ggplot2* commands and the routines found in this package.
